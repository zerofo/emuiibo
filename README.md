## Download

Make sure you always read the README and release changelogs (which are located on the release page)!

You will need the following files:

- emuiibo and emutool (grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/XorTroll/emuiibo/releases/latest))
- Tesla (grab the latest [Tesla-Menu](https://github.com/WerWolv/Tesla-Menu/releases/latest) and [nx-ovlloader](https://github.com/WerWolv/nx-ovlloader/releases/latest))

Extract all ZIP files and copy the folders on your SD card. It should look like this in the end:

- *emuiibo*: `sd:/atmosphere/contents/0100000000000352/exefs.nsp` and `/flags` folder
- *emuiibo overlay*: `sd:/switch/.overlays/emuiibo.ovl`
- *tesla-menu*: `sd:/switch/.overlays/ovlmenu.ovl`
- *nx-ovlloader*: `sd:/atmosphere/contents/420000000007E51A/exefs.nsp` and `/flags` folder

Always keep in mind that (if these contents were placed without turning off the console, using FTP, MTP, etc.) a reboot will be needed for emuiibo to actually work/reload!

## Virtual amiibos

Virtual amiibos go inside `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo`. For instance, an amiibo named `MyMario` would be `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo/MyMario/<amiibo content>`. They can go inside sub-directories, like `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo/SSBU/Yoshi`.

A virtual amiibo is detected by emuiibo based on two aspects: a `amiibo.json` and a `amiibo.flag` file must exist inside the virtual amiibo's folder mentioned above. If (for whatever reason) you would like to disable a virtual amiibo from being recognised by emuiibo, just remove the flag file, and create it again to enable it.

The JSON file contains all the aspects and data an amiibo needs to provide to games, except a few special ones (per-game savedata, protocol and tag type...)

This are the properties an amiibo has:

- Name: the amiibo's name (max. 10 characters, longer names will be automatically limited to 10 by emuiibo)

- UUID: it's a unique identifier for the amiibo, composed of 10 bytes. Common amiibo UUID values seem to have the last 3 bytes zeroed...?

- Random UUID: if this option is enabled (set to true), emuiibo will ignore the fixed UUID value and generate random UUIDs every time the amiibo is accessed by a game. This has potential benefits in certain games, like in BOTW, where amiibos can only be used once per day, but with randomized UUIDs this can be bypassed, and one can get infinite rewards scanning this amiibo infinite times.

- Mii: every amiibo has a mii associated with it (it's "owner"). Internally, miis consist on a 88-byte structure known as "char-info", so emuiibo stores this data in a file (typically `mii-charinfo.bin`). For new amiibos, emuiibo uses the console's services to generate a random mii, but for those who would like to use a mii from their console, emuiibo dumps in `miis` directory the console's miis, so it's just a matter of copying and pasting/replacing charinfo bin files. *NOTE*: emuiibo contains the charinfo file's name in the JSON (`mii_charinfo_file`), so if the file ever gets renamed, don't forget to rename it in the JSON too, or emuiibo will generate a random mii for the file name in the JSON.

- First and last write dates: these are (as if it wasn't obvious) the first and last time the amiibo was written/modified. When a virtual amiibo is created with emutool, the current date is assigned to both dates, and when the amiibo is modified in console, emuiibo updates the last write date.

- Write counter: this is a number which is increased everytime the amiibo is modified (and emuiibo does so, imitating Nintendo), but when the number reaches 65535, it is no longer increased (the number is technically a 16-bit number)

- Version: this value technically represents the version of Nintendo's amiibo library (NFP), so emuiibo just defaults it to 0.

### Virtual amiibo creation

While old emuiibo formats are supported and converted to the current format (see above), it is strongly suggested to, unless bin dumps might be indispensable, `emutool` be used, our PC tool designed to create virtual amiibos:

![Screenshot](emutool/Screenshot.png)

On the left half of the program:

- In the first dropdown menu on top, you can choose amiibos from a certain collection. In the second dropdown menu next to it, you can choose any amiibo you want to create.

On the right half of the tool:

- You can choose a name for the amiibo you want to create, a custom directory name (if you uncheck "Use name as directory name" below it).

- You can then choose if you want the amiibo to use randomized UUIDs. This means that the console always read it as a new/unique amiibo (some games have restrictions to use the same amiibo only once or once a day). Note that this might cause issues for games which save data into amiibos, so avoid using it on those!

- Then, you can choose if you want to save the amiibo picture shown on the left into the amiibo folder (it will be saved as a PNG file).

**Optional**:

- If you have a FTP connection on your switch console, you can directly save your amiibo on your SD into `/emuiibo/amiibo`

In the last step you click on "Create virtual amiibo" and choose a location, where you want to save it to. If an SD card with emuiibo is detected, the program will point to that SD's `/emuiibo/amiibo` folder.

Now you can copy the generated amiibo folder onto your SD card, in `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo` or in any subdirectories inside it!

### Supported figures

Some games (like Skylanders) make use of their particular NFC technology, aside from amiibos. This project ONLY emulates amiibos; therefore, in Skylanders' case, only the two special figurines with amiibo support can be emulated here, where emuiibo will only emulate the "amiibo part" of them.

### Areas

Areas (application areas, technically) are per-game amiibo savedata. Technically, real amiibos can only save data for a single game, but emuiibo allows as many games as you want (since savedata is stored as files). This savedata is quite small, and tends to be 216 bytes or smaller.

emuiibo saves this data inside bin files at `areas` directory inside the amiibo's directory, and the bin file's name is the game's area access ID in hex format.

An access ID is a unique ID/number each game has for amiibo savedata, used to check if the game actually has savedata in an amiibo. Here's a list of games and their access IDs:

### Per-game access IDs

| Game                                    | Application ID     | Access ID  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Splatoon 2                              | 0x01003BC0000A0000 | 0x10162B00 |
| Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove           | 0x010057D0021E8000 | 0x1016E100 |
| The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild | 0x01007EF00011E000 | 0x1019C800 |
| Super Smash Bros. Ultimate              | 0x01006A800016E000 | 0x34F80200 |
| Splatoon 3                              | 0x0100C2500FC20000 | 0x38600500 |
| The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening   | 0x01006BB00C6F0000 | 0x3B440400 |

Some of these IDs were obtained from [switchbrew](https://switchbrew.org/w/index.php?title=NFC_services#Access_ID).

## Usage and controlling

If you set up everything mentioned above, you're ready to use emuiibo ingame.

**Tip:** Enable it (emulation status) before you start a game, because it does not work in some games if you enable it after launching the game! It really depends on how the game uses amiibos internally, so this guarantees emuiibo will intercept the game.

To see if emuiibo is working ingame, check if emuiibo is intercepting the game when it's trying to access amiibos. If it's not, try launching the game with emuiibo enabled first.

To open the Tesla overlay, hold down **L1 + DPAD-down** and then press **R3 (right stick)**. If you did it, the overlay will open on the left side of the screen. Now choose emuiibo.

You can see/control the following options in the top part of the overlay:

- **Emulation status (on/off)**: when emuiibo's emulation status is on, it means that any game trying to access/read amiibos will be intercepted by emuiibo. When it's off, it means that amiibo services will work normally, and nothing will be intercepted. This is basically a toggle to globally disable or enable amiibo emulation.

- **Active virtual amiibo**: it's the amiibo which will be sent to the games which try to scan amiibos, if emulation is on. If the amiibo happens to have an image, this will be displayed in the top part of the overlay.

- **Virtual amiibo status (connected/disconnected)**: when the active virtual amiibo is connected, it means that the amiibo is always "placed", as if you were holding a real amiibo on the NFC point and never moving it - the game always detects it. When it is disconnected, it means that you "removed" it, as if you just removed the amiibo from the NFC point. Some games might ask you to remove the amiibo after saving data, so you must disconnect the virtual amiibo to "simulate" that removal. This is a recent feature, since emuiibo tried to handle this automatically in previous versions, causing some games to fail.

- **Random UUID (on/off)**: when a virtual amiibo is selected, this will toggle the random UUID option on the amiibo (see above), which will make emuiibo use randomized UUIDs any time a game accesses the amiibo.

In the main menu of the bottom part, You can browse virtual amiibos (and thus select them) through the (sub)directories in `sd:/emuiibo/amiibo`. You can also mark some of them as favorites, which can be easily accessed from a separate menu below.

After you selected an amiibo, you can see it's selected on top in the overlay and that it is *connected*.
A virtual amiibo being **connected** is the equivalent of holding a real amiibo figurine/card on the NFC point. To **disconnect** the amiibo (the equivalent of removing a real amiibo from the NFC point), just select the same amiibo again.

To go back in the menus, just press **B** button.

**Example of use**:

1. Open the overlay and choose emuiibo
2. Enable emuiibo
3. Start the game
4. Navigate to the games NFC feature to use the amiibo and activate it
5. Open the overlay and choose your amiibo (the amiibo will then be *connected*).
6. The game should now register/make use of it
7. If the game tells you to remove the amiibo, *disconnect* it.

## Boot procedure

- This is the list of actions emuiibo will automatically do when booting the console:

  - Console miis are saved at `sd:/emuiibo/miis/<index>`, both their name (in a text file since it might not be ASCII) and their data as a `mii-charinfo.bin` file.

  - Old amiibo formats (raw bin dumps and old virtual amiibo formats) are automatically converted to the modern format:

    - If `sd:/switch/key_retail.bin` is present, the bin dump's encrypted sections can be also used, which means that amiibo settings (mii, name, etc.) and game app-area (save-data), if present, are also extracted for the new format.

    - The bin dump file does not get removed, but it will get moved inside the modern amiibo format, along with the decrypted file.

## Compiling

In order to compile emuiibo you need to [setup Rust for Nintendo Switch development](https://github.com/aarch64-switch-rs/setup-guide). You'll also need devkitPro (devkitA64 specifically), in order to compile the overlay.

With this requirements satisfied, simply clone (recursively) this repo and hit `make`

## For developers

emuiibo hosts a custom IPC service, also named `emuiibo`, which can be used to control amiibo emulation by other homebrew tools.

The overlay's code serves a good example to see how to control emuiibo with libnx.
